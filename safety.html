            <div>
                <p>Cycling suffers from a perception that it is unsafe. This perception is not always backed by hard numbers, because of under reporting of accidents and lack of bicycle use data (amount of cycling, kilometers cycled) which make it hard to assess the risk and monitor changes in risks. In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking. In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance.However, in the UK for example the fatality and serious injury rates per hour of travel are just over double for cycling than those for walking.Thus if a person is, for example, about to undertake a ten kilometre journey to a given destination it may on average be safer to undertake this journey by bicycle than on foot. However, if a person is intending, for example, to undertake an hour's exercise it may be more dangerous to take that exercise by cycling rather than by walking. </p>

                    <h2>Physical trauma</h2>
                    <p>Acute physical trauma includes injuries to the head and extremities resulting from falls and collisions. Most cycle deaths result from a collision with a car or heavy goods vehicle, both motorist and cyclist having been found responsible for collisions.</p>

                    <h2>Overuse injuries</h2>
                    <p>Many cyclists suffer from overuse injuries to the knees, affecting cyclists at all levels. These are caused by many factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Incorrect bicycle fit or adjustment, particularly the saddle.</li>
                        <li>Incorrect adjustment of clipless pedals.</li>
                        <li>Poor training preparation for long touring rides.</li>
                        <li>Selecting too high a gear. A lower gear for uphill climb protects the knees, even though muscles may be well able to handle a higher gear.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Exposure to air pollution</h2>
                    <p>One concern is that riding in traffic may expose the cyclist to higher levels of air pollution, especially if he or she travels on or along busy roads. Some authors have claimed this to be untrue, showing that the pollutant and irritant count within cars is consistently higher, presumably because of limited circulation of air within the car and due to the air intake being directly in the stream of other traffic. </p>
